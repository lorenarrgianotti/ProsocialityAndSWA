Source localization analysis was performed using the standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography method (sLORETA; Pascual-Marqui, 2002). The sLORETA algorithm has been used in many sleep EEG studies (e.g., Bersagliere et al., 2017; Castelnovo et al., 2022; Moffet et al., 2020) and has been applied to estimate the cortical localization of NREM sleep sources (e.g., Fernandez Guerrero & Achermann, 2019; Siclari et al., 2018; Stephan et al., 2021). Using the manual regularization method in the sLORETA software, we selected the transformation matrix with the signal-to-noise ratio set to 10. 
For our voxel-by-voxel Pearson correlation analyses, we created a 15-mm sphere centered on MNI coordinates of the right temporoparietal junction (right TPJ: x = 54, y = -52, z = 32, Krall et al., 2015). 
We corrected for multiple testing in all of 59 voxels via a non-parametric randomization approach (Nichols & Holmes, 2001).
