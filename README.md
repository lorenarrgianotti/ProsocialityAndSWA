# ProsocialityAndSWA

In this repository we have stored all the material needed to reproduce the results of our project 'Prosociality and SWA'.

The "Data" folder contains the behavioral and the relevant pre-processed sleep EEG data of all 54 participants who took part in our study. As the size of the raw EEG data far exceeds the limit made available by GitHub, this data will only be made available on request.
All analyses were done with the softwares "Brain Vision Analyzer", "Matlab", "R", and "LORETA".

The "Code" folder contains the scripts we used for the visualisation of the results.
